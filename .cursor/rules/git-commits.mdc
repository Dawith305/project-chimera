# Git Commit Standards

## CRITICAL: Do Not Run git commit or git commit --amend

**The AI agent must NEVER run `git commit` or `git commit --amend` from the terminal.**

Cursor IDE automatically injects `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` into every commit made from its integrated terminal. There is no way to prevent this from within Cursor. The AI cannot avoid it by "not adding" it — Cursor adds it when the command executes.

### Required Workflow

1. **AI may:** Run `git add`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git pull`, `git push` (non-commit operations)
2. **AI must NOT:** Run `git commit` or `git commit --amend`
3. **AI must:** When a commit is needed, stage the files with `git add`, then provide the user with the **exact commands** to run from an **external terminal** (Terminal.app, iTerm — NOT Cursor's integrated terminal)

### Example

```
# AI has staged files. AI outputs to user:

"Files are staged. Run these commands from Terminal.app or iTerm (outside Cursor):

git commit -m \"feat(specs): Task 2.2 - Context Engineering

- .cursor/rules/project-chimera.mdc: Project context, Prime Directive, Traceability\"

git push origin feature/task-2.2-context-engineering
"
```

### Commit Message Rules (when providing commands to user)

- Never include `Co-authored-by:`, `Signed-off-by:`, or AI attribution
- Use conventional format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Keep messages concise
