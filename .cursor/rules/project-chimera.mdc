# Project Chimera — Agent Co-Pilot Context

## Project Context

**This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.** It is a fleet of goal-directed digital entities that research trends, generate content, and manage engagement without continuous human intervention. The system uses a **Planner → Worker → Judge** hierarchical swarm architecture, MCP-first integration, and governance-over-autonomy principles.

---

## The Prime Directive

**NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.**

Before writing any implementation:

1. Read the relevant spec: `specs/_meta.md`, `specs/functional.md`, `specs/technical.md`
2. Align your implementation with the API contracts, schemas, and user stories defined there
3. If a spec does not exist for what you are building, create or extend the spec before coding
4. Ambiguity is the enemy of AI — vague specs lead to hallucination

---

## Traceability

**Explain your plan before writing code.**

When implementing features:

1. State which spec(s) you are implementing (e.g. "Per specs/functional.md P-01, PL-01...")
2. Summarize your approach in 1–3 sentences before making edits
3. Link code changes to specific requirements or user story IDs when possible
4. Commit messages should reference specs or task IDs where relevant

## Key Reference Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs/_meta.md` | Vision, constraints, architectural principles |
| `specs/functional.md` | User stories (Planner, Worker, Judge) |
| `specs/technical.md` | API contracts, database ERD, MCP tool definitions |
| `specs/openclaw_integration.md` | OpenClaw availability/status plan |
| `research/architecture_strategy.md` | Architectural rationale and diagrams |

---

## Architectural Reminders

- **MCP-first:** Agents never call external APIs directly; all integration via MCP servers
- **Judge as gatekeeper:** All state-changing actions pass through the Judge
- **Spec-driven:** No implementation without a ratified specification
